= Open Simplex Particle Art
Simple processing project to draw some cool noise art.

To get this working clone the repo and open it as a sketchbook in the https://processing.org/[Processing IDE] 
Then add https://github.com/KdotJPG[Kurt Spenser]s OpenSimplexNoise gist which will be used as noise generator.
